# Translations Guide

You are welcome to help us translate the contents to other languages.

## How to translate

There are four languages available: English, French, Dutch and German. Because we are an Belgian community, and in Belgium there tree official languages: Dutch, French and German. And English is our consensus language.

### 1. Fork the repository

### 2. Create a new branch

### 3. Translate the contents

**First case**: _message_

In `/i18n/en.json` you have json files with formatted message ids and their translations.
So you can create a new file if it doesn't exist yet, and translate the message ids. Or you can update the existing files.

**Second case**: _content_

In `/content` you have the markdown files with the content. You can create a new file if it doesn't exist yet, and translate the content. Or you can update the existing files.
Don't forget the file format is `/content/file.[lang].md` where `[lang]` is the language code.

**DON'T FORGET TO TRANSLATE THE FRONTMATTER**
