# Writing content [WIP]

## Page content

If you have to write content for a page, please follow the guidelines below.

You have to write it in english. If you want to add a translation, please follow the [translation guidelines](./translation.md).

### File name

The selected will reflect the URL. So be simple and clear.

Don't miss to add lang in the file name. Like this format: `slug.lang.md` (example: `about.en.md`)

## Blog content

You are welcome to write blog posts for the website. Please follow the guidelines below.

You have to write it in english.

### File name

If you don't add lang, the website will not be able to render it.

### Front matter

We use [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to add metadata to the blog post.

```yaml
