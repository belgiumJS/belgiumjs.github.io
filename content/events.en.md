We want to provide some fun events.
But now we need to grow our community.

## How to propose an event

We will create an repo for events. _When it's done, you can put forward your ideas_

There are several things to think about:

- Is it in person or virtual?
- What is the topic? (a talk, a workshop, a hackathon, a social event, ...)
- Are you ready to organize it?
- Do you need help?
